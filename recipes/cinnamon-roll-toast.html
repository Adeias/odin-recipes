 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Picture layers of fluffy French bread coated in a decadent cinnamon-sugar blend<br> and topped with a luscious cream cheese glaze. It is part<br> cinnamon roll, part French toast, and 100% delicious. Whether you make it for breakfast, brunch, or<br> an afternoon snack, this is the easiest baked masterpiece to ever come out of<br> your oven.</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <h3>Bread</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 (11 ounce) cans original French bread dough (such as Pillsbury)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Glaze</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>3 ounce cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar</li>
    <li>3 to 4 tablespoons whole milk or half-and-half</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease<br> an 8.5- x 4.5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment<br> paper, allowing 2 inches to hang over the long sides. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the bread: Stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small<br> bowl until fully combined. Set aside. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a<br> work surface. Unfurl 1 of the cans of dough and gently stretch and/or roll<br> into a 10- x 12-inch rectangle. Brush 2 tablespoons of the butter evenly over<br> the entire dough. Sprinkle half (about heaping 1/3 cup) of the cinnamon-sugar<br> mixture to the edges of the dough to cover completely; lightly press<br> and smooth out to adhere (there will be some that falls off).</li>
    <li>Cut dough sheet into 12 even rectangles (about 3- x 3 1/2 inches).</li>
    <li>Stack dough rectangles on top of each other. Carefully transfer stack to<br> prepared pan with rectangles standing upright (like dominoes). Repeat with<br> remaining can of dough, butter, and cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
    <li>Transfer loaf pan to the preheated oven and bake until puffed and<br> golden, 40 to 45 minutes, tenting with foil after 30 minutes. Remove from<br> oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Use parchment as handles to<br> carefully lift loaf out of pan and onto a wire rack to cool to room<br> temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>While loaf cools, prepare the Glaze: Beat cream cheese in a medium bowl<br> with an electric hand mixer until whipped. Add powdered sugar, 3<br> tablespoons of the milk, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth and creamy,<br> adding more milk, 1 1/2 teaspoons at a time, until desired consistency is<br> reached.</li>
    <li>Drizzle desired amount of the glaze over warm or room temperature bread.</li>
    <li>Serve with remaining glaze on the side.</li>
 </ol>
